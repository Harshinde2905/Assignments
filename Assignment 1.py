2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Answer:-
String: It is a character representation used in conveying text information. String is passed with single or double quotes. Some operations we can perform on string are changing the case, splitting, finding length of string.

Variable: Variable is character which can store data in it. String is the data we can store in a variable. Operations are performed on these variables to get desired output.

3. Describe three different data types.

Answer:-
    1) Int - It is used  for whole number without any fractions. Various mathematical operations can be done on these like addition,substraction,division,multiplication.  
    2) Float - It is used for decimal numbers.Various mathematical operations can be done on these like addition,substraction,division,multiplication.  
    3) String - It is used for text data. Various operations like concatenation,split,case changes etc can be done.  
    4) Boolean - It is used for storing decisions like True or False.  
    5) List - It is used to contain different values of differnt types like int,float,string.it is represented by square [] brackets.   

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Answer:-
An expression is made up of literals or variables and operators. It is used to perform some 
operation on the given variables based on the operators. E.g to add 2 numbers, we can write
an expression a+b . Here a and b are variables and + is an operator. Similarly, different 
kind of operations can be done using expressions. These are the basic instructions which computer
can process.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

Answer:-
An expression is used to perform certain action based on operator and variables and produces
the results. Statement  does not do any calculations. Here spam = 10 is just a statement where spam 
will be 10. it does not evaluate any thing.

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

Answer:-
    bacon will still be 22 as we are not assigning back bacon +1 to bacon so it wont affect the original
value

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'   
'spam' * 3

Answer:-
spamspamspam
spamspamspam

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

and it should begin with either aplhabets or underscore.
So eggs is valid name as it begin with alphabet e while 100 is invalid as it begins with number

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

Answer:-
    int() - is used to convert the value to integer  
    float() - is used to convert the value to float  
    str() - is used to convert the value to string.  
    
    10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.'

Answer:-
Error has occured as we cannot add strings and integers, it can be avoided by conerting 99 into string using quotes.
'I have eaten' + '99' + 'burritos.'
or
"I have eaten 99 burritos."
